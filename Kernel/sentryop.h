>	class SentryOperation: public Operation

	Author:		Simon_Maneggio (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	15/2/94

	Purpose:	A SentryOperation is a non-undoable operation which hangs around on 
				the live operations list (receiving message broadcasts) for the lifetime of 
				the system.  

				Its a background, system helper sort of animal.  
				
				It will never be directly  invokable by the user, so there is no need to 
				declare an Init, GetState, or Do function for it. 

				An instance of the SentryOp class is created in the Application object.
				When it receives a message indicating a change in the system, it informs
				all subsystems that need to know about the change.
